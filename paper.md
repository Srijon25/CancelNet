# Summary
CancelNet is a software framework that intelligently identifies and responds to interrupt phrases in high-risk environments.

# Functionality
- Phrase matching with Sentence-BERT
- Risk profiling and confidence thresholds

# Example
Used in robotics, voice control, and autonomous systems.

# Acknowledgements
