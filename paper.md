# Summary

**CancelNet** is a modular and extensible software framework designed to intelligently detect and respond to interrupt phrases in risk-sensitive environments. The framework integrates semantic phrase recognition with configurable risk profiles to allow dynamic control over system interruptions. This ensures safer operations in domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, critical decision platforms, and voice-controlled machinery.

# Statement of Need

Modern systems increasingly rely on natural language interfaces, yet many lack robust mechanisms to interpret and react to user interruptions. Conventional approaches are often brittle, relying on hard-coded keyword matching or rule-based triggers. CancelNet addresses this limitation by introducing semantic similarity detection, customizable confidence thresholds, and a simulation mode for safe validation.

# Functionality

CancelNet includes:
- Phrase detection using Sentence-BERT embeddings
- Configurable risk profiles (low, medium, high)
- A centralized interrupt controller with real-time logging
- Simulation mode for phrase testing and performance auditing
- Modular components for easy integration into external systems

# Example

An example use-case is a voice-controlled medical device that must halt operation upon hearing a high-risk command like “stop now” or “abort procedure.” CancelNet ensures these commands are semantically matched and actioned appropriately based on confidence thresholds.
